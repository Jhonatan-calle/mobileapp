# ⚕️HealWiz App 

A modern healthcare tool called HealWiz gives customers access to individualized health management options. By utilizing an advanced technology stack comprising **Flutter, Firebase, Flask (Python), TensorFlow  and Google Gemini**.

HealWiz effectively combines image recognition, artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostics, and data analytics to offer precise disease identification, customized medication recommendations, and insightful health information. While putting data protection first, HealWiz guarantees a simple and easy-to-use interface and a safe communication structure for users. HealWiz is the ideal partner for anyone looking to manage their healthcare proactively and intelligently, whether they're diagnosing conditions using image analysis or getting tailored treatment suggestions.


Our challenge is to simplify and streamline healthcare management by providing users with accurate disease identification, tailored prescriptions, valuable health insights, seamless history-saving, and eventually, personalized post-diagnosis support through a chatbot, all within an intuitive mobile application at one place.

## 👨🏻‍💻Technical Components - Products and Platforms:
We chose **Flutter** for its cross-platform compatibility and smooth UI development. **Firebase** was selected for its seamless integration of backend services, including authentication, cloud storage, and history-saving capabilities. **Flask (Python)** was used for its lightweight web framework to handle server-side logic, while **TensorFlow** enabled powerful image recognition capabilities. In the future, the addition of a chatbot functionality will further enhance user engagement and support. Also, Integrated **Google Gemini** for AI assistance for a better assistance.
